# Turkish-semantic-verbal-fluency-analysis
The repo includes three methods to analyze SVF sequences:

* Troyer method
* Bigram method
* Vector space modelling (Word2vec)

Codes were created based on a Semantic Verbal Fluency data collected from Turkish sample. Due to data confidentiality, the source file (animal.csv) was created hypothetically.  Since model files  are extremely large, Word2vec folder is empty and needs to be add later for user.
